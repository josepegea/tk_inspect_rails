# TkInspectRails

Use [TkInspect](https://github.com/josepegea/tk_inspect) with Rails
applications.

At this time it provides:

- A custom inspector for `ActiveRecord::Relation`
- A panel to perform raw SQL queries

See [TkInspect](https://github.com/josepegea/tk_inspect) for more
details about using the environment.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'tk_inspect_rails'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install tk_inspect_rails

## Usage

You need to add the `tk_inspect_rails` gem to your Rails project and
run `bundle install`.


After that you can launch the graphic console with Rails loaded with
this command.

    bundle exec tk_rails_console

Inside the console you should have access to all classes in your app,
including models.

**WARNING**: This is very much a work in progress. More documentation
to come!!
